Based on Hyderabad’s Air Quality Index (AQI) and concentration changes of the six major pollutants from 2022 to 2023, the results are visualized through descriptive statistics, and the air pollution status and influencing factors of Hyderabad’s AQI are analyzed using the ARIMA model . A forecast system is built and the fitting effects of the two models are compared. The results show that PM2.5, PM10, and O3 of the six major pollutants have the greatest impact on AQI. Hyderabad’s air quality now shows a trend of improvement in recent years; however, there is obvious seasonal evidence that the winter pollution index has been high. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the treatment of ozone pollution in winter. ARIMA model is useful for the forecast of AQI. Moreover, when using the additive seasonal model for the long-term forecast of monthly data, it is found that the Hyderabad AQI still shows seasonal cyclicality and has a slightly decreasing trend in the next two years. This research provides a basis for the forecast of air quality and policy enlightenment for environmental protection departments to deal with air pollution.
